# Property-based Testing

A Clojure work-through of the book
[Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/fhproper/property-based-testing-with-proper-erlang-and-elixir)
by Fred Hebert. PBT book's [older site](https://www.propertesting.com/).

I really solidified my learning of Erlang through [Fred Hebert's
work](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/) and respect all the stuff I've seen him
put out. Although I'm not actively coding in Erlang or Elixir right now, I
thought it would be useful to buy this book and work through it, since I feel
there's something I'm not quite "getting" about property-based tests. As I
read through, I'm working through the exercises in three languages: Erlang and
Elixir (as laid out in the book) and Clojure (which I will capture here and
also the language I write in day-to-day for work).

My intent is to commit snippets in the order code appears in the book.
Theoretically, someone could then use the commit history to reproduce a
reading of the book.
